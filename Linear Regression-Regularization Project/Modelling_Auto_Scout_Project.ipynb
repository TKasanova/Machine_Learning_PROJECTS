    "While starting you should import the necessary modules and load the data given as pkl file. Also you'll need to do a few pre-processing before moving to modelling. After that you will implement ***Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression,and Elastic-Net algorithms respectively*** (After completion of Unsupervised Learning section, you can also add bagging and boosting algorithms such as ***Random Forest and XG Boost*** this notebook to develop the project. You can measure the success of your models with regression evaluation metrics as well as with cross validation method.\n",
